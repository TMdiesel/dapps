Before considering a task done
- Code builds without type errors (`npm run build`).
- Key flows manually verified on Sepolia (login → AA init → (optional) sponsored transfer → balance/NFT refresh).
- Error cases checked (network error, missing env, sponsor disabled/insufficient policy).
- Minimal logs added/updated (no PII); developer panel shows useful context.
- Documentation updated (docs/aa-demo-design.md and/or README) if behavior/config changed.
- Suggested commands stay accurate.
- TODOs converted to issues or removed if not needed.
